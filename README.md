# The-SIMON-game
The Simon Game Project is a web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players follow and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that grows progressively. JavaScript manages random sequences, user input, and game logic, while CSS adds animations and styling. Itâ€™s a fun way to showcase interactivity, memory skills, and DOM manipulation.
